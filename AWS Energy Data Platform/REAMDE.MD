## Architecture

```plaintext
IoT Sensors  -->  AWS IoT Core  -->  Amazon Kinesis  -->  S3 (Raw Data)
                                           |
                                        AWS Glue
                                           |
S3 (Processed Data)  -->  Amazon Redshift/Athena  -->  Amazon QuickSight
                                           |
                                        SageMaker
                                           |
                                       Lambda + SNS
```

The architecture ensures that data flows seamlessly from collection to visualization, enabling real-time insights and data-driven decision-making.

## Functional Components

### 1. Real-Time Data Collection
**AWS IoT Core** and **Amazon Kinesis** ensure seamless ingestion of data from IoT sensors. Data is continuously streamed into the system, allowing for immediate processing and storage.

#### Example Data:
```json
{
  "sensor_id": "Sensor01",
  "timestamp": 1672531200,
  "energy_consumption": 320.5,
  "status": "active"
}
```
#### Data Flow:

---

### 2. ETL Pipeline
Data is processed using **AWS Glue** to clean and transform raw sensor data into a structured format for analysis. The pipeline ensures high-quality data preparation, ready for downstream analytics.

#### Key Benefits:
- Automates data cleaning and transformation tasks.
- Scales effortlessly with growing data volumes.

#### Script Highlights:
```python
mapped_frame = ApplyMapping.apply(
    frame=datasource,
    mappings=[
        ("sensor_id", "string", "sensor_id", "string"),
        ("timestamp", "double", "event_time", "timestamp"),
        ("energy_consumption", "double", "consumption", "double"),
        ("status", "string", "status", "string")
    ]
)
```
---

### 3. Data Storage and Analytics
- **Amazon S3**: Acts as a data lake for raw and processed data, supporting flexible data storage and retrieval.
- **Amazon Redshift**: Serves as the data warehouse for efficient querying and large-scale analytics.
- **Amazon Athena**: Provides SQL-based queries directly on S3 data, enabling fast insights without setting up additional infrastructure.

#### Example Query (Athena):
```sql
SELECT sensor_id, AVG(energy_consumption) AS avg_consumption
FROM energy_data
GROUP BY sensor_id;
```
---

### 4. Machine Learning
**Amazon SageMaker** trains a predictive model to identify anomalies in energy usage. This allows the platform to proactively address inefficiencies and potential issues.

#### Key Features:
- Supports end-to-end machine learning workflows.
- Integrates seamlessly with other AWS services for data access and model deployment.

#### Model Training Script:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
---

### 5. Visualization
Create interactive dashboards using **Amazon QuickSight** to monitor KPIs such as:
- Average energy consumption.
- Anomaly trends.
- Status of sensors.

#### Customizable Dashboards:
Dashboards can be tailored to display specific metrics for different stakeholders, such as operational teams, managers, or compliance officers.

### 6. Alerting System
**AWS Lambda** triggers alerts for anomalies detected in real time, sending notifications via **Amazon SNS**. This ensures critical events are immediately brought to attention.

#### Example Use Case:
- Notify maintenance teams when energy consumption exceeds a threshold.
- Send weekly summary reports to managers.

#### Lambda Function:
```python
sns.publish(
    TopicArn="arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:EnergyAlerts",
    Message=f"High energy consumption detected: {consumption} kWh",
    Subject="Energy Alert"
)
```
