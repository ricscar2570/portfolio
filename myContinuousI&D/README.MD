#CI/CD Pipeline with Monitoring and Alerting 🚀

This project demonstrates a fully automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a web application. It includes robust monitoring and alerting, ensuring seamless application delivery and system health visibility.

By utilizing Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana, this project showcases how to streamline the software lifecycle and maintain high performance in a production-ready environment.
##🛠️ Features

    Automated CI/CD Workflow: Automated build, test, and deployment using Jenkins.
    Containerized Application: Using Docker for portability and scalability.
    Kubernetes Orchestration: Scalable deployment with AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
    Real-time Monitoring and Alerting: Application and infrastructure health monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana.
    Version Control Integration: Seamless integration with GitHub for repository management.
    Cloud-Native Hosting: Deployed on AWS for high availability and performance.

##🖥️ Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
Jenkins	Continuous Integration and Deployment
Docker	Containerization of the application
Kubernetes	Container orchestration
Prometheus	Monitoring and alerting
Grafana	Visualization of metrics and dashboards
AWS (EKS)	Cloud-based Kubernetes hosting
GitHub	Source control and versioning
##📋 Prerequisites

    Docker installed on your machine.
    Kubernetes cluster (AWS EKS or local with Minikube).
    Jenkins server (local or cloud-based).
    Prometheus and Grafana set up in the Kubernetes cluster.
    AWS CLI and kubectl configured to manage the EKS cluster.

##🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ci-cd-monitoring-pipeline.git
cd ci-cd-monitoring-pipeline

2. Build and Run the Application Locally

    Build the Docker image:

docker build -t web-app:latest application/

Run the application:

    docker run -p 5000:5000 web-app:latest

    Access the application at http://localhost:5000.

3. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

    Set up Jenkins:
        Install required plugins: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub.

    Create a Pipeline:
        Use the Jenkinsfile provided in the jenkins directory.

    Trigger Builds:
        Commit and push changes to GitHub to start the pipeline.

4. Deploy to Kubernetes

    Set up the cluster:

        Create an AWS EKS cluster:

eksctl create cluster --name ci-cd-pipeline --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name linux-nodes --node-type t2.micro --nodes 2

Configure kubectl:

    aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name ci-cd-pipeline

Deploy manifests:

    Apply Kubernetes configurations:

        kubectl apply -f kubernetes/namespace.yaml
        kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
        kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml

5. Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

    Deploy Prometheus and Grafana:
        Use Helm charts:

    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --create-namespace

Access Grafana:

    Port-forward to access Grafana locally:

        kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring

        Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000. (Default credentials: admin/admin).

    Import Dashboards:
        Use the JSON file monitoring/grafana/dashboards/example-dashboard.json to set up metrics visualization.

    Configure Alerts:
        Use the alerts.yaml file for Prometheus alerting rules.

##📈 Monitoring Dashboard Preview

(Add a screenshot of your Grafana dashboard here to illustrate metrics visualization.)
###🧪 Testing
    Push a commit to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.
    Verify that the Docker image is built and pushed.
    Ensure the application is deployed to Kubernetes.
    Monitor metrics in Grafana and check for alerts in Prometheus.
