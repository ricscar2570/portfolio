CI/CD Pipeline with Monitoring and Alerting

(Optional: Add a relevant project image or logo)
🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a web application. It integrates build, test, deploy, and monitoring workflows, providing a robust framework for automating application deployment and performance management.

By leveraging tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana, this pipeline ensures smooth and efficient application delivery while maintaining high visibility into system health.
🛠️ Key Features

    Automated CI/CD Workflow: Seamless build, test, and deployment using Jenkins.
    Containerized Application Deployment: Reliable and scalable deployments via Docker and Kubernetes.
    End-to-End Monitoring: Real-time metrics and alerting powered by Prometheus and Grafana.
    Version Control Integration: Fully synchronized with GitHub for repository management.
    Cloud Hosting: Deployed on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for robust and scalable hosting.

🖥️ Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
Jenkins	Continuous Integration and Deployment
Docker	Containerization of the application
Kubernetes	Orchestration of containerized applications
Prometheus	Monitoring and alerting for system metrics
Grafana	Visualizing performance and monitoring dashboards
GitHub	Source code management and version control
AWS (EKS)	Cloud hosting and Kubernetes management
📋 Prerequisites

    Docker Installed on your local machine.
    Kubernetes Cluster (AWS EKS recommended, or Minikube for local testing).
    Jenkins Server setup (self-hosted or cloud-based).
    Prometheus and Grafana deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.
    AWS CLI and kubectl configured for AWS EKS access.

🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ci-cd-monitoring-pipeline.git
cd ci-cd-monitoring-pipeline

2. Jenkins Configuration

    Install Jenkins plugins for Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub integration.
    Configure a Jenkins pipeline using the provided Jenkinsfile.

3. Dockerize the Application

    Build the Docker image:

    docker build -t your-app:latest .

    Push the image to your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

4. Deploy to Kubernetes

    Apply Kubernetes manifests:

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/

Verify the deployment:

    kubectl get pods

5. Monitoring Setup

    Deploy Prometheus and Grafana:

kubectl apply -f monitoring/

Access Grafana:

    kubectl port-forward service/grafana 3000:3000

    (Default credentials: admin / admin)

6. Configure Alerts

    Define Prometheus alert rules in prometheus/alerts.yaml.
    Configure Grafana dashboards for visual insights.

🧪 Testing the Pipeline

    Trigger the Pipeline: Push a commit to the GitHub repository to start the Jenkins pipeline.
    Verify Deployments: Ensure the application is successfully deployed to Kubernetes.
    Monitor Metrics: Check Prometheus and Grafana for application health and performance metrics.
