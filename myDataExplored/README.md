# Interactive Dashboard Project

Welcome to the Interactive Dashboard Project! This dashboard enables users to explore and analyze complex datasets through interactive filters, dynamic charts, and customizable visualizations. It can be adapted to analyze business, demographic, financial, or any relevant data types.

## Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Filter data based on categories or date ranges to narrow down the insights.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Visualize data through responsive, interactive charts using Plotly.js and D3.js.
- **Customizable Views**: Change visualization types, adjust filters, and personalize the dashboard to suit analysis needs.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Data processed in Python and served efficiently through a Node.js backend.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Easily deployed using Docker and MongoDB as a flexible and scalable database.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, D3.js, Plotly.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Data Analysis**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Docker, Heroku

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Docker: Make sure Docker is installed on your machine.
    MongoDB: If not using Docker, ensure MongoDB is available for the backend.

Installation

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-dashboard.git
cd interactive-dashboard

Setup Environment Variables:

    Navigate to backend/.env and add your MongoDB URI:

    MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/dashboard

Run the Application:

    Start all services using Docker Compose:

        docker-compose up --build

        This command will build and run the frontend, backend, and MongoDB services.

    Access the Dashboard:
        Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the dashboard in action.

Usage

    Data Filtering: Use the dropdown menu to filter data by category (e.g., Finance, Demographics).
    Interactive Charts: The chart dynamically updates based on selected filters.
    Data Upload: Add new datasets by using the API or data ingestion script.

API Endpoints

    GET /api/data: Retrieves data. Supports optional query parameter category to filter results by category.
    POST /api/data: Adds a new data entry. Accepts a JSON body with fields category, value, and timestamp.

Data Preprocessing (Python)

To preprocess and load data into MongoDB, run the data_preprocessing.py script:

cd data-analysis
python3 data_preprocessing.py

Deployment

The project is set up to deploy seamlessly with Docker and Heroku. To deploy on Heroku:

    Create a Heroku app and link it to this repository.
    Add the MongoDB connection URI to Heroku's environment variables.
    Deploy via the Heroku dashboard or CLI.
