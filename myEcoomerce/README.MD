# myEcommerce - Intelligent E-Commerce Platform

myEcommerce is an advanced and personalized e-commerce platform designed to offer an optimal shopping experience. The system integrates cutting-edge technologies, including **Node.js backend**, **React frontend**, **machine learning for personalized recommendations**, **containerization with Docker**, **orchestration with Kubernetes**, and **monitoring tools** like **Prometheus and Grafana**, to ensure a secure, scalable, and high-performance application.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the architecture of a modern e-commerce platform.
- Learn how to integrate machine learning for real-time personalized recommendations.
- Gain experience with containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Implement advanced security measures like 2FA, data encryption, and attack prevention.
- Monitor and analyze application performance using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Key Features

- **Product and Order Management**: APIs for CRUD operations on products and order management.
- **Advanced Authentication and Security**: Two-factor authentication (2FA), sensitive data encryption, XSS and CSRF attack prevention.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Machine learning model to suggest personalized products based on purchasing behavior.
- **CI/CD and Orchestration**: Automated pipeline with Jenkins, containerization with Docker, and orchestration using Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring and Analysis**: Dashboards with Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring, and sales analysis reports using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Complete System Workflow

1. **Registration and Login with Two-Factor Authentication**: 
   - Users can securely register and log in. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is implemented with OTP sent via email.

2. **Browsing and Recommendations**:
   - Users can browse and add products to their cart while receiving personalized real-time recommendations based on their shopping behavior.

3. **Checkout and Order Management**:
   - Orders are managed securely, with integration options for payment systems (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to enable a complete checkout process.

4. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Administrators can monitor the ecosystem through Prometheus and Grafana dashboards and generate visual sales reports.

5. **Automation with CI/CD and Continuous Deployment**:
   - The platform is continuously updated using a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins and managed with Kubernetes for scalability and high availability.
