Real-Time Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Prometheus Configuration

    Create a prometheus folder and add a prometheus.yml file:

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'backend'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:5000']

Run Prometheus:

    docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v $(pwd)/prometheus/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus

Prometheus will be available at: http://localhost:9090.
Grafana Configuration

    Run Grafana:

    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana

    Access Grafana at: http://localhost:3000 (default credentials: username admin, password admin).

    Add Prometheus as a data source:
        Navigate to Configuration > Data Sources > Add data source.
        Select Prometheus and use http://localhost:9090 as the URL.

    Create dashboards and use queries like node_cpu_seconds_total to monitor metrics.
